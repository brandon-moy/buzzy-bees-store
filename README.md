## ðŸ¤” Why I built this?

After creating <a href="https://github.com/brandon-moy/ecommerce-admin">ecommerce-admin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/brandon-moy/ecommerce-store">ecommerce-store</a>, I wanted to make the store repository reusable and create an example of cloning the repo. BuzzyBees is an ecommerce store for bee and beekeepers to purchase their supplies.

BuzzyBees is a working ecommerce site but it meant to be viewed as a portfolio piece.
